TODO:

Clustering Option 1: Machine Learning that identifies photo features and then clusters off of that (similar features go together)
I think I have this working to a degree. 
TODO: Visualize the output and decide if it's doing anything right
TODO: Plug it into the existing generation class

Clustering Option 2: Image hashing and then bitwise clustering (photos with similar "hash distance" go together)
Build a pipeline where I can plug in different hash functions
    Should use hierarchical k means on the hash, but then also use the raw image to compute the centroid
    Seems like this works, going to test with the existing ts file
    Note that the hash might be too tight (see if this is fixable)

    Problems :
    Hash isn't great on these images (dissimilar images are clustered)
        Determine if this is because of Kmeans or if the hash is too tight
        Try a new clustering algorithm that works on hamming distance
    Problem: The newer hierarchical k means isn't creating centroids.




TODO: Make generic hierarchical k means function + class
